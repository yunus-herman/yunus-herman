### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 My name is Yunus Herman
 
 I am a versatile data analyst and data scientist with a proven track record in data crawling as well as building and maintaining
databases. My goal is to deal with todayâ€™s typical information overload by formulating and presenting clear
and concise analyses. I have lived and worked in three different continents with different cultures and
languages, which has made me adaptable and open to new ideas and situations.
